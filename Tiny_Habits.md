# Tiny Habits

## 1. Tiny Habits - BJ Fogg

**Question 1 - What was the most interesting story or idea for you?**

**Answer:**

One of the most interesting ideas BJ Fogg shares is that small habits can lead to big behavior changes. He illustrates this with stories of people who started with tiny actions, like flossing one tooth or doing one push-up, and eventually built significant routines. The insight is that habits don’t have to start big—they just need to start.

## 2. Tiny Habits by BJ Fogg - Core Message

**Question 2 - How can you use B = MAP to make new habits easier? What are M, A, and P?**

**Answer:**  

B = MAP stands for **Behavior = Motivation × Ability × Prompt**.  
- **M (Motivation):** How much do you want to do the habit?  
- **A (Ability):** How easy it is to do the habit.  
- **P (Prompt):** The trigger that reminds you to do the habit.  

To make habits easier:  
- Increase **Motivation** by connecting the habit to something you enjoy.  
- Increase **Ability** by simplifying the habit.  
- Strengthen **Prompts** by placing cues in visible or memorable locations.

**Question 3 - Why is it important to "Shine" or Celebrate after each successful completion of a habit?**  

**Answer:** 

Celebrating signals to your brain that this habit is positive and worth repeating. It reinforces the behavior and increases the likelihood that it becomes automatic. BJ Fogg emphasizes: “What you celebrate grows.”

## 3. 1% Better Every Day

**Question 4 - What was the most interesting story or idea for you?**

**Answer:**

The most interesting idea is the **compound effect of small daily improvements**. Improving just 1% each day may seem insignificant, but over a year it can lead to enormous growth. The video also shares stories of people achieving remarkable results through consistent, tiny actions rather than drastic changes.

## 4. Atomic Habits

**Question 5 - What is the book's perspective about Identity?**

**Answer:** 

Atomic Habits emphasizes that **true behavior change comes from identity change**, not just goal setting. Instead of focusing on outcomes (like “I want to run a marathon”), focus on becoming the type of person who embodies that behavior (like “I am a runner”). Habits reinforce your identity.

Make habits obvious, attractive, easy, and satisfying:  
- **Obvious:** Place cues in plain sight.  
- **Attractive:** Pair the habit with something enjoyable.  
- **Easy:** Reduce friction and simplify the steps.  
- **Satisfying:** Reward yourself to reinforce the habit.

**Question 7 - How to make a habit harder to do?**

**Answer:**

 To break bad habits, make them invisible, unattractive, difficult, and unsatisfying:  
- **Invisible:** Remove visual cues.  
- **Unattractive:** Reframe the habit negatively.  
- **Difficult:** Increase friction or obstacles.  
- **Unsatisfying:** Remove immediate rewards.
